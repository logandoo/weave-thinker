## §M Operating Modes (AUTO / GUIDED)

Every task declares exactly one line in ZERO (§2), before any code action:

```
Mode: AUTO        (default — agent takes over end-to-end)
Mode: GUIDED      (user asked for more involvement / approval points)
```

**The modes differ ONLY in who decides Class-I questions.** Everything that
constitutes *evidence* is mode-invariant: COV-1 tests-executed, COV-2
script-only, COV-5 verifier announced, COV-7 loop bounds, COV-8/A4.9 review,
COV-9 baseline, the assert_artifacts.py exit-0 gate, the Final Memory Gate,
and the entire A4.4 completion output. GUIDED completion = AUTO completion;
the difference is only whether a human was consulted at Class-I points.

### Class-I interaction points (mode-dependent)

| # | Trigger (canonical section) | GUIDED | AUTO |
|---|------------------------------|--------|------|
| I1 | Ambiguous / under-specified request (§2 Step 0.1) | STOP and ask, one question at a time | Derive the **most conservative** interpretation the evidence supports → ADR → proceed |
| I2 | Vague acceptance criteria (A4.1 Step 1) | STOP and ask | Derive strict criteria from the request's explicit words → ADR → proceed |
| I3 | Design Gate A/B confirmation (COV-10 / A5.1) | Explicit confirmation request | Record chosen approach + rejected alternative as ADR → proceed |
| I4 | Baseline has pre-existing failures (COV-9) | Report + await decision | ADR: proceed ONLY if failures are provably out of task scope (name failing areas + why out of scope); else fix-first |
| I5 | Mid-loop criterion add/drop/relax (A4.1 Step 1) | Ask the user | ADR quoting the exact criterion edit |
| I6 | cap=5 / stall=3× reached (COV-7) | Report to user | §A4.10 shift FIRST; PAUSED packet only on a SECOND capped sub-problem |

### Class-E hard stops (BOTH modes — AUTO never auto-decides)

1. COV-11: fetched content conflicts with the user's request or this skill.
2. Production deploy / release to real users / anything touching live
   customer data.
3. Destructive or irreversible operations outside the project tree:
   force-push, branch deletion on shared remotes, data deletion, DNS /
   infra / IAM mutation.
4. Credential exposure, or secret handling beyond what the task explicitly
   provided.
5. `assert_artifacts.py` exit 1 with no legal repair path (never edit the
   script, never fabricate output — escalate).
6. Anything the user explicitly asked to be consulted on (that request is a
   standing Class-E override).

Class-E stops ALWAYS emit a PAUSED packet (§P) — a stop without a resume
packet is the failure mode this contract exists to prevent.

### ADR format

`tests/decisions.md` — append-only, created on the first AUTO decision:

```
## D-3 | 2026-08-29T14:05Z | iter 2
trigger: I4 — baseline has 2 pre-existing test failures
options: (a) fix pre-existing failures first (b) proceed, failures out of scope
chosen: (b) proceed — failures in legacy export path; task touches import path only
why: failing tests target modules/legacy_export.py, untouched by this task's diff
revisit-if: any new failure names modules/legacy_export.py or the same DB table
```

Rules: one block per decision · `why:` must be falsifiable · `revisit-if:`
names an observable condition · never rewrite an old ADR (append a new one
superseding it). The completion output adds `[Decisions] N auto-decisions →
tests/decisions.md` before the 8-column table.

**Proactive ADRs** (no Class-I stop fired — e.g. a design-doc decision):
record one only when ALL three hold — hard to reverse · surprising without
context · the result of a real trade-off; skip otherwise (obvious or
reversible choices need no ADR).

**User veto path:** the user may veto any ADR post-hoc (it is in the repo
history). A veto is recorded as feedback memory (A7.9), the affected work is
redone in the next change-wave (own COV-9 baseline), and the veto reason
joins the project's ⛔/feedback entries.

**AUTO runaway bound:** AUTO buys autonomy, not license to spin. At most ONE
extra autonomous direction per stop type (I6: one §A4.10 shift before any
pause). ≥3 ADRs on the SAME sub-problem → the next stop is a PAUSED packet
regardless of mode.

---

## §P PAUSED / Resume Contract

Every turn that stops for a gate — either mode, Class-I or Class-E — MUST
end with BOTH:

1. `tests/paused_state.md` written with the packet below.
2. The same one-liner as the LAST line of the reply (human-visible):

```
[PAUSED] gate=<name> | question=<one line> | options=<2-3> | default-if-continue=<option> | state=<wave, files touched, next step>
```

Field semantics: `gate:` names the rule that fired (I4 / COV-9 · I6 /
cap-stall · Class-E: COV-11 …) · `options:` are the 2-3 candidate actions ·
`default-if-continue:` is what the agent will do on an unqualified
"continue" · `state:` names the change-wave, the files already touched, and
the literal next step.

**Resume semantics:** a user "continue" (or any reply that does not pick an
option) = approval of `default-if-continue`. It is NOT a re-plan: the agent
does not re-derive context, re-ask settled questions, or restart the loop.
On resume: delete/clear `tests/paused_state.md`, append
`- resumed: <default> approved` to `tests/verification_log.md`, continue from
`state:`. A reply that picks a DIFFERENT option overrides the default; log
`- resumed: <chosen option> (user override)` instead.

**Re-entry order after a gap** (SKILL.md §3.3): paused_state.md (if present)
→ tests/acceptance.md in full → verification_log.md tail (~40 lines; full
read only if <200 lines or inconsistent) → §1 covenant recall. Name the pass
(C1/C2/C4-C7) + first action in one line before acting.

**Batching:** ONE packet per pause, never a drip of questions. In GUIDED,
all pending Class-I questions of the current phase collapse into the single
packet's `options:`.

**Frontier rounds (GUIDED, ≥2 pending Class-I questions):** the single
packet is one *frontier round*:
1. Number each question; each carries its own recommended answer (its
   `default-if-continue`).
2. Order by dependency — a question whose answer depends on a still-open
   question belongs to the NEXT round, not this one.
3. **Facts vs decisions:** never ask the user for a fact discoverable from
   the environment (files, git, config, tools) — look it up or dispatch a
   subagent. A running lookup is an unsettled prerequisite: questions
   downstream of it wait; ask the rest of the frontier now. Only *decisions*
   go to the user.
4. Termination: frontier empty = nothing left silently assumed → proceed.

This refines the per-phase collapse above; single-ambiguity clarification
(I1 · REFERENCE.md §A5.1 Gate A) stays one-question-at-a-time. AUTO is
unchanged (ADRs, no frontier).

---

## S1. Spike (Feasibility Probe)

**Trigger:** the request is a feasibility question ("can we…?", "is it
possible…?", "quick and dirty is fine") whose deliverable is an ANSWER, not
code you keep. Classified at §3.1; route here instead of C1/C2.

1. Present the question + probe plan in 2-3 sentences (what you will try and
   how you will judge it). GUIDED: get a nod first. AUTO: write the probe's
   pass/fail question into `tests/acceptance.md` as the criteria.
2. Investigate as cheaply as correctness allows. No design docs, no plan
   document, no §A4.8 TDD — the probe is throwaway by definition. §2 ZERO
   research still applies (a spike is not a license to guess).
3. Report findings as a recommendation (feasible / not / under-what-
   conditions), probe evidence (logs, transcripts) under `tests/`.
4. **Anything built stays labeled throwaway. Keeping spike code = a new
   request:** reclassify at §3.1 (usually C2) with its own COV-9 baseline —
   probe code never drifts into production ungated.
5. Completion: the A4.4 table + gate line as usual; evidence is the probe
   log. `HARD-GATE-2=na` when nothing was built or started (state why).

---

## C4. Audit (Read-Only Task)

**Trigger:** the primary deliverable is a review/report of an existing
codebase — code audit, security review, architecture assessment, migration
readiness check. NOT for fixing: fixes discovered by an audit become a
follow-up C2 task (record them in the report's remediation section).

**Read-only boundary:** no source, config, or script edits anywhere in the
target repo. Writes are limited to: `docs/AUDIT_<date>_<slug>.md`,
`tests/acceptance.md`, `tests/verification_log.md`, `tests/decisions.md`,
`memory/`. Violating the boundary voids the audit (the deliverable is
trust).

Binding order:

1. `0 §2 ZERO + Mode line → 1 scope & criteria`: decompose the audit
   request into explicit, individually-checkable criteria — coverage areas
   (which modules/paths/qualities), depth, output language — into
   `tests/acceptance.md` (first line `> cap=5  stall=3×` preserved; COV-7
   bound applies to the audit pass itself). Ambiguity → Class-I rules.
2. `2 READ-ONLY pass`: systematic inspection per criterion. Use search
   tools + reads; keep evidence quotes (file:line + 1-2 line excerpt) as you
   go — an audit note without a locator is not a finding candidate.
3. `3 findings`: each finding = severity (Critical / Important / Minor) ·
   dimension (`Bugs` logic/edge cases · `Security` injection/authz/secrets/
   attacker-controlled input · `Compliance` matches stated requirements) ·
   file:line · why it matters · **PoC command or quoted-code argument**.
   A finding without repro/quote evidence is NOT a finding — it is a
   hypothesis; verify or drop it. Nit cap: itemize at most 5 Minors, count
   the rest.
4. `4 independent verification`: Critical + Important findings are verified
   by a fresh-brain subagent (opencode `task`, READ-ONLY) given the finding
   list + PoCs — verdict per finding: CONFIRMED / REFUTED / UNCERTAIN.
   REFUTED → recorded as ruling, never silently dropped. UNCERTAIN →
   downgrade to "suspected" in the report.
5. `5 report`: `docs/AUDIT_<date>_<slug>.md` — scope & method · findings
   (verified, with evidence) · remediation plan (ordered, each item = a
   future C2 task) · what was NOT covered (named, with reason).
6. `6 completion`: A4.4 table + gate line with `Loop executed: no` ·
   `HARD-GATE-1: NO-TEST-NO-DONE=na` (zero code change — the *evidence* is
   the PoC outputs, which MUST be executed and logged to
   `verification_log.md` as `- audit-evidence:` lines) · `Code review: N/A`
   with `A4.9 not triggered` reason. COV-9 skipped (nothing modified).

---

## C5. Deploy Workflow

**Trigger:** the task releases a build to an environment (staging, prod,
app store, server, container registry). Engineering standard stands
(ENGINEERING_STD §A7): **production deploys are human-confirmed — the agent
prepares (build, changelog, rollback path); the user authorizes the
production action.** C5 makes that rule mechanical.

Binding order:

1. `0 §2 ZERO + Mode line → 1 pre-deploy checklist` (ALL must be green
   before the deploy action):
   - baseline GREEN on the release commit (COV-9, own change-wave);
   - pending DB migrations dry-run in a throwaway env (or documented N/A);
   - **rollback script exists**: `script/deploy/rollback.sh` (+ `.bat`) or
     documented manual rollback path — writing the rollback path IS part of
     the deploy task, never an afterthought;
   - version/changelog recorded (tag or release note).
2. `2 build via script/` (COV-2; artifact checksummed or named).
3. `3 DEPLOY ACTION` = **Class-E stop in BOTH modes** unless the user
   pre-authorized it IN WRITING for this task (`decisions.md` D-0 line:
   `D-0 deploy-authorization: <env> — authorized by user in task request`).
   To staging/dev with no real users: AUTO may proceed with an ADR (env is
   disposable); to production: always the PAUSED packet.
4. `4 post-deploy smoke`: A4.7b real-HTTP workflow traces (1-3 business
   flows) against the DEPLOYED environment — `tests/workflows/*.trace.log`
   with the deployed URL named. `E2E depth: real-HTTP` in the gate line.
   Smoke failure → treat as incident (C6 triage rules), never "it worked
   locally".
5. `5 rollback drill`: execute the rollback script ONCE against staging
   (or a canary), verify service returns to the previous version, re-deploy
   the new version. A rollback path that was never executed is a hypothesis.
6. `6 completion`: A4.4 table (evidence = smoke traces + drill log) +
   deployment record in memory/ (date, env, version, rollback point, smoke
   results).

---

## C6. Ops / Incident Workflow

**Trigger:** live breakage, alarms, user-reported production failure, or
routine maintenance waves (dependency upgrades, cert rotation, backup
restore checks).

**Incident path** (something is broken NOW):

1. `0 triage FIRST — evidence before fixes (A4.6 Phase 1)`: capture the
   failure state (logs, metrics, error output) BEFORE touching anything;
   reproduce or bound the blast radius; identify the last-known-good version
   (git tag/commit + deploy record).
2. `1 incident record`: open `docs/POSTMORTEM_<date>_<slug>.md`
   (APPENDIX §A9 template) with trigger → timeline → impact. It is a chain
   artifact: cite the alert/log that started it.
3. `2 hotfix via C2`: full C2 discipline with ONE relaxation — the COV-9
   baseline is the pre-incident commit (or last-known-good deploy), and the
   baseline run may be skipped if the system is DOWN (state
   `COV-9 skipped — active incident, system unavailable; baseline =
   <last-known-good>` in the log). Every other gate applies.
4. `3 verify`: fix + suite green + the ORIGINAL failure evidence re-captured
   (the exact symptom that started the incident must be shown resolved).
5. `4 postmortem`: complete the record — root cause, fix commit hash,
   **one permanent regression case** added to the test suite so the incident
   can never recur silently.
6. `5 memory`: ⛔ (if ≥3 failures preceded the fix) / ❌ failed attempts /
   feedback per A7.9 + A4.4 completion table.

**Maintenance path** (nothing is broken): dependency upgrades and similar
waves run as C2 with a bound — **≤5 upgrades per change-wave**, each wave
gets its own COV-9 baseline + suite run; a red wave stops the batch (don't
mix 10 upgrades into one undiagnosable wave). One upgrade per commit inside
the wave, so bisect works.

---

## C7. Non-Web Runtime (CLI / Library / Batch / Pipeline)

**Trigger:** the change's runtime surface is NOT a browser page (→ §A4.1)
and NOT an HTTP API (→ §A4.7): CLI output, library behavior, data pipeline,
batch job, daemon without HTTP.

**1. Profile:** write `tests/project_profile.json` in the FIRST change-wave:
`{"profile": "cli"}` (CLI/batch/pipeline) or `{"profile": "library"}`
(library). This declaratively skips structurally-N/A assert groups (see
Profile Reference) — every applicable group stays enforced. COV-2 applies
to whatever lifecycle scripts the project actually has (a library's
`script/` may hold only test/release helpers — that's fine; the profile
documents why start/stop/restart don't exist).

**2. Acceptance criteria over OBSERVABLE output:** each criterion names a
checkable runtime observation — exit code for given input · stdout/stderr
content (exact or pattern) · files written (path + content shape) · timing
bound · golden-output equality. "Works correctly" is not a criterion.

**3. Evidence (replaces Playwright):** per flow, save to `tests/`:
- invocation transcript: command line + full stdout/stderr + exit code
  (`tests/<flow>.run.log`);
- output diff against a golden file where output is deterministic
  (`tests/<flow>.diff`);
- for pipelines: the artifact produced (file path + checksum) logged.
Screenshots/mm-sensor do not apply: announce `Verifier: direct read
(non-web)` at Step 0 and cross-check every criterion against the transcript
+ artifact on disk. assert_artifacts group 3's screenshot checks still
apply to any png you DO cite; group 11 checks cited media — cite none.

**4. §A4.8 test-first** for all logic-bearing code (a library's public API
IS logic-bearing): RED → GREEN per the standard cycle.

**5. Loop:** Act → Verify (transcript + artifacts vs criteria) → Fix → Log
(`verification_log.md`, `diagnosis:` on every FAIL), cap=5 / stall=3×,
§A4.10 on stall. For libraries also run the DOWNSTREAM check: import/use
the library from a throwaway consumer script (`tests/consumer_smoke.py`) —
green unit tests do not prove the package installs or imports.

**6. Completion:** A4.4 table; gate line `Verifier: direct read (non-web)` ·
`Loop executed: yes` · `E2E depth: service-direct` (or `unit-only` with the
A4.7b ladder reason).

Profile sources: `--profile <name>` flag overrides `tests/project_profile.json`
(`{"profile": "<name>", "no_service": bool?, "no_ui": bool?,
"no_new_project": bool?}` — explicit keys override the preset). A profile
SKIPS a group only when it is structurally impossible; it never weakens an
applicable group. The script prints its profile interpretation (`profile: …
— … N/A`) as part of the gate evidence; the completion table's
`assert_artifacts.py: pass=N/fail=0` counts only executed assertions.
